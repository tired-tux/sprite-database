# What is the Sprite Database?
The Sprite Database is for when you want to go somewhere but you dont know how good their sprite is. Our rating is on a scale from one to ten in these three categories:
- Fizz
- Flavor
- Sweetness
# How to lookup a location?
1. Goto `entries` and find the state (Ex: VA)
2. Find the city (Ex: Alexandria)
3. Find the street (Ex: King)
4. Find the address number (Ex: 1743)
5. Read up on the rating and think "Do I want Sprite, or something else?"
# I can't find it!
If you don't find it, follow these steps:
1. Goto that place and taste the Sprite
2. Rate each category on a scale from 1-10. There is no need to average anything, as my script does all the math.
3. Send me an email at vmlinuz@duck.com and use the email template below.
- Hello. I wish to add a location to the database.
- [Address]
- [Fizz]
- [Flavor]
- [Sweetness]
- [Notes]
4. Send it to me and I will add it ASAP.
